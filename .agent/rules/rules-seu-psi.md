***SeuPsi Development Rules Using Antgravity/AI***
1. Technical Autonomy and Setup

    Antgravity agents have full freedom to install, configure, and optimize MCPs to fulfill roadmap objectives.

    Development must be fully based on real data — avoid mocks entirely.

    Progress must follow the roadmap with logical sequencing and robust production-ready features.

2. Documentation and Communication Language

    All documentation, progress reports, and communication must be produced in português﻿

    to ensure clarity and accessibility for the main user group.

    Code snippets, configuration files, scripts, and prompt instructions should be written in English to maintain standardization and interoperability.

3. Code Quality and Rules Compliance

    Strictly comply with all project rules and policies.

    Never introduce false or fabricated data during any phase of development or testing.

    Prioritize maximum performance and high autonomy in the agent's execution.

4. Data Integrity and History Tracking

    Record all agent thought processes, decisions, and processing steps.

    Maintain a historical log by generating and updating hash records stored in a JSON file for auditability and traceability.

5. Prompt and File Writing

    Output prompt files and related configuration in English.

    Preserve the logic and context of communication primarily in Portuguese throughout documentation and dialogues.

6. Continuous Improvement

    Agents should seek ongoing optimizations in performance, user experience, and data integrity.

    Adjust workflows autonomously for efficiency gains without violating documentation and language rules.
